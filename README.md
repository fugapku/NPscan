# NPscan
NPscan: scanning genomes for natural product gene clusters
####################

The program is designed for predicting natual product gene clusters in fungi genomes. To get a quick idea on how to run NPScan RORA, please follow example.R. For additional details, please look into the code for specific functions inside myFun.NP.R.

File information
  myFun.NP.R -- contains many functions used in Natural product gene cluster predictions and related problems
  myFun.NGS.R -- contains some additiona functions required by some functions in myFun.NP.R
  NPGCquery_meta.txt -- an example meta data file for NPscan, it specifies the genome sequence & annotation files, compiled R binary data files, and identifiers used in the genome annotation file
  WalshL5_20p99enzymeOnly20160802cluster_info.xlsx -- an example meta data file for RORA.pipeline
  example.R -- example script with detailed explaination on the key function arguments
  data -- a folder contains precompiled binary data for 30 genomes, mostly of Aspegillus.
